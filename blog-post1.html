      <p>Many small business owners start their Facebook page full of energy. They post a few times, get busy with work, and stop posting for weeks or months. Sound familiar? It happens to a lot of people — but staying consistent online is one of the easiest ways to build trust with your customers.</p>

      <h3>1. People Remember What They See Often</h3>
      <p>When people see your business post regularly, they start to recognize your name, logo, and what you offer. Even if they don’t buy right away, your business stays in their mind. So when they need your product or service, they’ll think of you first.</p>

      <h3>2. It Shows You’re Active and Reliable</h3>
      <p>When a Facebook page hasn’t posted in months, people often wonder if the business is still open. But when you post consistently, it shows your business is active, reliable, and professional. That’s how trust starts — by simply showing up.</p>

      <h3>3. It Keeps Your Page Alive</h3>
      <p>Regular posts keep your page looking fresh. They also help more people see your business because Facebook gives more attention to active pages. More posts = more chances to reach new customers.</p>

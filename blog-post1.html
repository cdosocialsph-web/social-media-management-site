      <p>In today‚Äôs online world, staying visible is just as important as what you post. Many small businesses create a few posts, get busy, and then stop ‚Äî but the secret to real growth lies in one word: <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>

      <h3>1. Consistency Builds Recognition</h3>
      <p>When people see your content regularly, they start to recognize your logo, tone, and personality. That‚Äôs how familiarity grows ‚Äî and familiarity builds trust. Over time, followers begin to remember your business and recommend it naturally.</p>

      <h3>2. The Algorithm Rewards You</h3>
      <p>Social platforms love active pages. When you post consistently, the algorithm shows your content to more people, helping your brand stay on top of feeds without spending more on ads.</p>

      <h3>3. Engagement Follows Predictability</h3>
      <p>Posting regularly means your audience knows when to expect new content. This increases interaction rates and keeps your page feeling alive and active.</p>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúPeople trust brands that show up ‚Äî not just once, but all the time.‚Äù</blockquote>

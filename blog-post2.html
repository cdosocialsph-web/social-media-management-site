      <p>Have you ever wondered how well your Facebook posts are doing? Facebook gives you a free tool called <strong>Insights</strong> that shows how people interact with your page. You don‚Äôt need to be a tech expert to use it ‚Äî just knowing the basics can help your business grow.</p>

      <h3>1. What Are Facebook Insights?</h3>
      <p>Facebook Insights show numbers and graphs that tell you how your posts perform. It‚Äôs like a report card for your page. You‚Äôll see how many people saw your posts, how many clicked, liked, or shared them, and when your audience is most active online.</p>

      <h3>2. The Most Important Numbers to Watch</h3>
      <ul style="text-align:left; max-width:700px; margin:20px auto;">
        <li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many people saw your post.</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> How many liked, commented, or shared your post.</li>
        <li><strong>Page Views:</strong> How many people visited your page.</li>
        <li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many new people followed your business.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These numbers help you see what kind of content your audience enjoys. If your photo posts get more likes than text-only posts, you‚Äôll know what works best.</p>

      <h3>3. Why It Matters</h3>
      <p>Understanding your Insights helps you make smarter choices. You‚Äôll know what to post more of, what to improve, and when your audience is online. This helps your page grow faster and keeps your customers more engaged.</p>

      <h3>4. How CDOSocialsPH Can Help</h3>
